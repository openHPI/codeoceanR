# CodeOcean R Quiz
# Berry Boessenkool, berry-b@gmx.de, early 2020 + Oct 2020
# Generated by rt_setup_exercise

# This script is run by `rt_score()` (in Rstudio) or by clicking "Score" (in CodeOcean).
# Running this script may never fail on CodeOcean, hence keep it wrapped in `try()`.
# The object 'task_id' must be defined here for the error messages through `rt_warn`.
# The tests must be connected with "&&", not "&" to avoid generating multiple messages.
# ("&&" stops evaluating on the first FALSE it encounters).
# The tests are set up so the rt_warn messages are increasingly specific.
# See also https://github.com/openHPI/codeoceanR#teachers

npassed <- 0 # number of passed tests

# Keep the following at the end of the script, for CodeOcean scoring:
